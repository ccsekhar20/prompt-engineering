LLM-based project as a Software Intern at Quadrant Resource (2023):

Project Description:

Created an advanced project that involved the development of an LLM Python script using LangChain tools and OpenAI's GPT-4 for extracting information from PDFs. This script was integrated into a text-based search engine, allowing users to query PDFs in a user-friendly manner. To enhance efficiency, content similarity searches between PDFs were implemented using Facebook's FAISS. Additionally, a connection with ChromaDB was established to optimize structured document collection and improve data management. The project also focused on enhancing data categorization and analysis by creating similarity search indexes and automatically generating JSON summaries of PDFs within the application.
